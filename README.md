## Getting Started

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/pandidorty

# Admin Seeding (for npm run seed:admin)
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@pandidorty.cz
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_password_here
```

### Installation

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Database Setup

Make sure you have a PostgreSQL database running and configured in your `.env` file.

### Admin User Creation

Create an admin user for accessing the admin panel:

```bash
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_password npm run seed:admin
```

Or add `ADMIN_PASSWORD` to your `.env` file and run:

```bash
npm run seed:admin
```

### Development

Start the development server with HMR:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Building for Production

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment

To build and run using Docker:

```bash
docker build -t my-app .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-app
```

The containerized application can be deployed to any platform that supports Docker, including:

- AWS ECS
- Google Cloud Run
- Azure Container Apps
- Digital Ocean App Platform
- Railway

### DIY Deployment

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

```
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json (or pnpm-lock.yaml, or bun.lockb)
├── build/
│   ├── client/    # Static assets
│   └── server/    # Server-side code
```

## Styling

This template comes with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) already configured for a simple default starting experience. You can use whatever CSS framework you prefer.
